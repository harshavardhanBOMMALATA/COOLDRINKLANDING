# 🥤 CoolDrink Landing Page

## 🚀 Introduction

CoolDrink is a vibrant and refreshing single-page landing website designed to showcase three exciting drink flavors with dynamic theme changes. Each flavor transforms the background and content to create a unique mood and interactive experience. The project focuses on smooth animations, clean UI design, hover effects, and modern glass-style cards to make the page feel energetic and engaging.

This project is built as a simple frontend-only website and is perfect for showcasing UI skills in a resume or portfolio.
